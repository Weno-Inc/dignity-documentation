##
**Installation**
To install Dignity, clone the repository:

``
git clone https://github.com/Weno-Inc/Dignity
cd dignity
``

##
**Writting Dignity code**
create a ``.dig`` file with some Dignity code like this:

``
A: header: | style: 1: #6278 2:#2827 | click: on-time |
var x = 10
var y = 20
var result = x + y $ Add x and y $
B: h1: | style: must(1: #6278 2:#2827) | click: on-time | $ This is a comment $
C: body: | style: 1: #6278 2:#2827 | click: on-time |
D: messages: | style: 1: #6278 2:#2827 | click: on-time |
Runner: A 1,2,3 | B 1,2,3 | C 1,2,3 | D 1,2,3 |
``

##
**Running Dignity Code**
Run the Dignity code using the provided script:

``
python run_dignity.py example.dig
``

##
**Syntax Reference**
Sections
Sections are defined using capital letters followed by a colon (:). Each section can contain various elements like styles, click events, and variables.

``
A: header: | style: 1: #6278 2:#2827 | click: on-time |
``

##
**Variables**
Variables are declared using the var keyword followed by the variable name, the = symbol, and the value.

``
var x = 10
var y = 20
var result = x + y $ Add x and y $
``

##
**Comments**
Comments are added using the $ symbol and are enclosed within dollar signs.

``
$ This is a comment $
``

##
**Styles**
Styles are defined within a section using the style keyword followed by style definitions.

``
style: 1: #6278 2:#2827
``

##
**Click Events**
Click events are defined within a section using the click keyword followed by the event type.

``
click: on-time
``

##
**Runners**
Runners define the sequence of sections to be executed.

``
Runner: A 1,2,3 | B 1,2,3 | C 1,2,3 | D 1,2,3 |
``

##
**Examples**

Example 1: Basic Style and Click Events

``
A: header: | style: 1: #6278 2:#2827 | click: on-time |
``

Example 2: Variable and Arithmetic Operation

``
var x = 10
var y = 20
var result = x + y $ Add x and y $
``

Example 3: Full Example with Sections and Runner

``
A: header: | style: 1: #6278 2:#2827 | click: on-time |
var x = 10
var y = 20
var result = x + y $ Add x and y $
B: h1: | style: must(1: #6278 2:#2827) | click: on-time | $ This is a comment $
C: body: | style: 1: #6278 2:#2827 | click: on-time |
D: messages: | style: 1: #6278 2:#2827 | click: on-time |
Runner: A 1,2,3 | B 1,2,3 | C 1,2,3 | D 1,2,3 |
